### Why work with me?
* **20 + years** maintaining, troubleshooting, and upgrading electro-mechanical systems—from semiconductor tools to airport train controls.
* Eight years hands-on with **FDM 3-D printing, scan-to-CAD, and Fusion 360** design.
* I’ve seen what works (and what always breaks). Field experience lets me **engineer parts that survive real-world abuse**, not just look good on-screen.

### What I do
| Capability | What you gain |
|------------|---------------|
| **Reverse-engineering** (3-D scan → parametric CAD) | Rapid, drop-in replacements for obsolete parts |
| **DfAM redesign & prototyping** | Lighter, stronger, ready-in-24 h parts |
| **Short-run FDM production** (PLA → CF-Nylon) | Bridge the gap between prototype & mass production |
| **Innovative solution consulting** | Practical, cost-cutting ideas rooted in two decades of maintenance |

### Selected wins
* **$750 k saved** by redesigning legacy parts for in-house printing.
* **RFID-bypass soap adapter** cut consumable costs **$500 k / yr**.
* **HVAC valve coupler**: 98 % cost reduction, same-day spares for 20-year-old chillers.

### Credentials
* **B.S. Electronics & Communications Engineering Technology** (Honors)
* **OSHA 30-hr** General-Industry Safety
* FTA **Transit Safety & Security** certifications
* Cleared to work on critical-infrastructure sites

#### How I work
1. **Listen & measure** – quick call or site visit, capture exact requirements.
2. **Model & iterate** – Fusion 360 design with screenshots/GIFs for feedback.
3. **Prototype & test** – carbon-fiber or high-temp polymers as needed.
4. **Deliver** – CAD files, print profiles, and (if you want) digital inventory so you can print spares on demand.
