title: "Beyond Plastic: Engineering Sustainable Alternatives"
---

### The Challenge
Many organizations rely on petroleum-based plastics, creating excessive waste and raising sustainability concerns.

### My Solution
1. Researched biodegradable polymers and plant-based composites to identify suitable replacements.
2. Developed and printed prototype parts using high-strength, eco-friendly filaments.
3. Tested the samples to confirm durability comparable to conventional plastics.

### Impact
- Demonstrated the feasibility of swapping to biodegradable materials.
- Offered a clear path for reducing environmental impact without sacrificing performance.
