title: "Tailored Retrofit: How 3D Printing Prevented a $400K Expense"
---
### The Challenge
A customer was exploring the replacement of 264 vintage 1960s-era light poles at an estimated cost of $400,000 to accommodate an LED lighting upgrade. These poles had long been discontinued, and no accessories or compatible components remained in production. Consequently, no off-the-shelf solutions were available to effectively waterproof the pole tops after the retrofit, leaving them exposed and vulnerable.

### My Solution
* Conducted detailed on-site measurements and developed precise digital models of the pole head profile.
* Fabricated **264** custom, UV-resistant **ASA** caps utilizing advanced FDM 3D printing technology.
* Delivered a watertight, custom-fit solution, enabling the installation crew to successfully complete the retrofit on schedule.

### Impact
* **$400,000 in cost savings**
* **Preservation of the facilityâ€™s original historical aesthetic**
