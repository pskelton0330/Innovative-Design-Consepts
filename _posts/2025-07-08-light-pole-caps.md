title: "Custom Light-Pole Caps Save $400 k"

### The Challenge
1960s-era light poles at Dulles had a geometry no longer manufactured.
LED retrofits left the tops exposed; full pole replacement was quoted at **$400k**.

### My Solution
* Measured pole head → modelled exact profile in **Fusion 360**
* Printed **264** UV-resistant **ASA** caps on Voron 2.4 & Bambu X1C
* Delivered watertight fit; install crew finished retrofit on schedule.

### Impact
**$400,000 saved • 60% lead-time reduction • Historic look preserved**
