### The Challenge  
1960 s-era light poles at Dulles had a geometry no longer manufactured.  
LED retrofits left the tops exposed; full pole replacement was quoted at **$400 k**.

### My Solution  
* Measured pole head → modelled exact profile in **Fusion 360**  
* Printed **264** UV-resistant **ASA** caps on Voron 2.4 & Bambu X1C  
* Delivered watertight fit; install crew finished retrofit on schedule.

### Impact  
**$400 000 saved • 60 % lead-time reduction • Historic look preserved**
