### The Challenge
New terminal restrooms at **Reagan National Airport** included sinks with proprietary Purell® soap dispensers.
Each refill cartridge has an RFID tag; non-authorized soap is rejected, locking MWAA into **$0.56 / oz** consumables (up from $0.04 / oz). Projected annual over-spend: **≈ $500 000**.

### My Solution
* Disassembled a stock refill, measured the RFID neck, and **designed a screw-on adapter** in Fusion 360.
* Adapter mates a standard 1-gal bulk soap jug to the existing RFID cap, fooling the faucet’s reader.
* Printed prototypes in **chemical-resistant PETG-CF**; final units in FDA-compatible polypropylene via Bambu X1C.
* Delivered STL + print settings; janitorial staff now print spares on demand.

### Impact
* **≈ $500 000 annual savings** on consumables.
* Zero changes to plumbing or electronics; swap takes < 30 s.
* Reduced plastic waste by reusing bulk jugs instead of single-use cartridges.
