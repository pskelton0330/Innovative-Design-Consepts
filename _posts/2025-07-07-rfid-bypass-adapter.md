title: "Smart Adaptation: 3D Printing Solutions for Facility Maintenance Savings"
---
### The Challenge
A customer renovated multiple bathrooms in their large facility without realizing the new built-in sinks featured soap dispensers designed exclusively for proprietary refill cartridges. Each cartridge included an RFID tag that rejected any non-authorized soap, locking the customer into costly consumables at **$0.56 per ounce** (previously **$0.04 per ounce**). The projected annual overspending amounted to approximately **$500,000**.

### My Solution
I developed a custom soap bottle adapter allowing the RFID-tagged nozzle from the proprietary cartridges to screw securely onto the original, cost-effective **$0.04 per ounce** bulk soap refills.

Prototypes were 3D printed using chemical-resistant **ASA** plastic for durability.

Delivered comprehensive CAD and STL files, along with optimized printing profiles, enabling the customer to independently produce adapters using low-cost FDM 3D printers.

### Impact
* Annual savings on consumables: approximately **$500,000**.
* No modifications required to existing bathroom facilities.
* Significant reduction in plastic waste by utilizing reusable bulk jugs instead of disposable cartridges.
