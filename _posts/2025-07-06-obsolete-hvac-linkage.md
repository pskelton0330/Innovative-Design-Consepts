title: "Obsolete HVAC Linkage Printed in 45 min"

### The Challenge
Reagan National’s HVAC shop had two plastic motor linkages crack on legacy chill-water compressors.
The OEM part is discontinued; sourcing used inventory showed **3-month lead times** and ~$300 each cost.
A failed linkage can disable an entire compressor, risking downtime during peak summer demand.

### My Solution
* Took on-site caliper measurements and sketches; **modelled replacement** in Fusion 360 in 30 min.
* Printed prototype in **Reinforced PETG-CF** (0.15 mm layers, 40 % gyroid infill).
* Delivered and installed within 48 h; fit and function verified by HVAC technicians.
* Batch printed four spares; each additional unit takes **≈ 45 min** and <$5 in material.

### Impact
* **Avoided compressor downtime** and costly emergency rentals.
* **98 % cost reduction** per linkage (<$5 vs. $300).
* On-demand digital inventory—shop can print replacements the same day a failure occurs.
