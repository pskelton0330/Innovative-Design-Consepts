### The Challenge  
A facilities-maintenance customer oversees several **20-year-old chilled-water compressors**. Within two months, **two compressors failed** when a small **plastic motor-shaft coupler** sheared.  
* OEM no longer manufactures the coupler.  
* Only way to buy one is to purchase the entire motor-coupler assembly (≈ \$300, **3-month lead time**).  
* A broken coupler disables a compressor, risking costly downtime during peak summer demand.

### My Solution  
1. **On-site measurement** – captured critical dimensions in 30 minutes using digital calipers and reference sketches.  
2. **DfAM redesign in Fusion 360** – modelled a drop-in replacement with reinforced fillets and a slightly wider hub for longer service life.  
3. **Rapid prototype** – printed first article in **carbon-fiber nylon** (0.15 mm layers, 40 % gyroid infill).  
4. **Fit-check & install** – coupler installed within 48 hours; HVAC techs reported perfect alignment and torque transfer.  
5. **Digital inventory delivered** – provided STL/STEP files, material specs, and print profile so the shop can print spares on demand.  
6. **Batch of four spares** printed (≈ 45 min each, < \$5 in material).

### Impact  
* **Downtime averted** – compressors back online in two days (vs. three-month wait).  
* **98 % cost reduction** – \< \$5 per coupler vs. \$300 motor-assembly.  
* **Future-proofed maintenance** – facility now has **digital stock** and can produce replacements the same day a failure occurs.
