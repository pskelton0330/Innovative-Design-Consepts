### The Challenge
A facilities-maintenance customer managed several **20-year-old chilled-water compressors**. Over a short period, **two compressors** failed when small **plastic motor-shaft couplers** sheared.

- Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) had discontinued the couplers.
- Replacement required purchasing an entire motor-coupler assembly (~$300 each, with extensive lead times).
- Each broken coupler rendered a compressor inoperable, risking significant downtime, especially during peak demand periods.

### My Solution
1. **On-site Measurement:** Accurately captured critical dimensions using digital calipers.
2. **Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM):** Engineered a redesigned coupler optimized specifically for additive manufacturing, incorporating enhanced structural features such as reinforced fillets and a widened hub to improve durability and performance.
3. **Rapid Prototyping:** Created an initial prototype using robust, engineering-grade materials suitable for additive manufacturing.
4. **Fit and Installation Verification:** Successfully installed prototype, with HVAC technicians confirming precise fit, alignment, and torque transfer.
5. **Final Production:** Delivered replacement parts and additional spares printed in carbon-fiber nylon, providing high strength and excellent temperature resistance.

### Impact
- **Cost Efficiency:** Achieved approximately 98% cost reduction from original OEM assembly price.
- **Future-Proof Maintenance:** Facility now possesses immediate access to durable spares, ensuring operational continuity.
